### Hello there 👋

(˵ •̀ ᴗ •́ ˵ ) ✧ Hi! I'm Maico. I'm a data enthusiast who has worked at the intersection of financial planning, analytics, business intelligence, and digital transformation. I enjoy data-driven work because it's a good mix of technology, relationship-building, and creative problem-solving.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked with directors and service delivery leads to develop analyses and internal tools that provide insights into financials, productivity, and resource optimization. By focusing on the end-user experience, I ensure that applications and dashboards deliver maximum value—whether for agents or leadership. I help teams make smarter decisions by simplifying complex processes and building low-cost, effective digital transformation solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, volunteering, and unwinding with documentaries and video games.
